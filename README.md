A pet project I made to practice spring and Java. Later on I added
(and then completely rewrote) frontend on React.
<p/>
Project uses Spring with Spring Security.
Also uses <a href="https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin"> frontend-maven-plugin </a>
to package front and backend into one executable.

React frontend is built using Vite. Uses useForm, redux-toolkit, react-query, axios. Has been recently migrated to TypeScript.
